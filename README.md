# walkability-score-EPB
We (Zhao, J., Sun, G., & Webster, C) publish the script used for constructing and calculating a pedestrian network-based walkability score, for knowledge exchange.
The research outcome has been published on EPB, a renowned peer-reviewed journal in the field of urban planning. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2399808320977871
