This file attaches junction scores for five areas of HK together
It used to include only ten categories and uses the files with name ending "...algo_junction_scores",
but later I added an Entropy Score calculation, so the final files should be those
ending with "algo_junction_scorefull".

the file name ending with "_sa" is the algorithm used for sensitivity analysis. some table names
are changed to sa related tables. other than that, the algorithm remains the same.
