`1.data preparation` contains sql scripts that:

-take edge table ( city_[projection]_edges[_modifications] ) and create an
edge_table with pgr_createTopology ( city_projection_edges[_modifications]_tolerance ),
in the process automatically creating a junction table (city_[projection]_edges[_modifications]_tolerance_vertices_pgr)
-take a POI table ( city_[projection]_poi[_modifications])  and create a 
POI table associated with pgr edge table (city_projection_poi[_modifications]_tolerance_pgr)

-some queries scripts to check everything is working

For hki and maw, the scripts are separate, but for kow and lan, all scripts are combined to one for each area, 
called "place_32650_topo_poi.sql", namely, created topology for edges and associated POIs with those edges. 

The process has been reordered and simplified as the most efficient, and the output files use the updated 
naming conventions from "walkability naming conventions.txt".

abbr.: hki = HK Island; maw = Mawan Island; kow = Kowloon and New Terriroty; lan = Lantau
* we removed the airport island due to the lack of walking network.
* kow is further divided into kow1 and new based on kowloon_zones and kowloon_buf50

NEW/OLD TABLE NAMES:
place_32650_edges_1_noded <-> place_32650_edges_noded_1_topo_1 -> topology network

-The original boundary for new territory is not well created, so I am creating another one called "new_terri_zone"
